## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## 🚀 Real-Time Monitoring Scripts

ServerPulse includes comprehensive real-time monitoring scripts that update all metrics every 5 seconds.

### 📊 What's Monitored in Real-Time:

- **CPU Load & Usage** - Real-time CPU performance
- **Memory (RAM) Usage** - Current memory utilization
- **Network Activity & Throughput** - Network traffic monitoring
- **Disk Usage & I/O** - Storage and disk performance
- **Response Time** - Server response latency
- **System Uptime/Downtime** - Server availability tracking
- **Threshold Alerts** - Automatic alert generation
- **Performance Logging** - Historical data collection

### 🖥️ For macOS/Linux Users:

```bash
# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x run-monitor.sh

# Start comprehensive real-time monitoring
./run-monitor.sh
```

### 🪟 For Windows Users:

```cmd
# Start comprehensive real-time monitoring
run-monitor.bat
```

### 📈 Monitoring Features:

- **5-second update interval** for all metrics
- **Queue worker** for background processing
- **Real-time broadcasting** of status updates
- **Automatic threshold checking** and alert generation
- **Performance log cleanup** (keeps last 1000 entries per server)
- **Status summaries** every 50 seconds
- **Graceful shutdown** with Ctrl+C

### 🎯 What the Scripts Do:

1. **Start queue worker** for background processing
2. **Monitor servers** and broadcast status updates
3. **Update all metrics** (CPU, Memory, Network, Disk, Response Time)
4. **Check thresholds** and generate alerts
5. **Clean old logs** to prevent database bloat
6. **Display summaries** of monitoring status

### 🛑 Stopping the Monitoring:

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the monitoring service gracefully.
